                    My name is Byron Brown and my friends call me Bebo. Growing up on a small dairy farm in a small town in central PA has taught me the 
                    value of a good work ethic and integrity. Though I love my hometown and will probably move back there one day, I had to explore the 
                    world. I love technology so the decision to move to Seattle was simple
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up always fascinated with video games. I remember watching older cousins of mine playing video games and simply being enthralled. 
                    This fascination grew into a desire to replicate the feelings and emotions I experienced. I also grew into a musician where composing
                    music became a hobby. Why not put the two together?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love the Seattle's indie video game culture. That was one of the reasons I moved here in the first place. Through meetups and 
                    game jams I have gotten to know the indie culture well and hope to establish an exciting career in audio for video games. Why web
                    development? I want to grow my skills as a programmer, so I can speak game developerâ€™s language. Also, it will provide me a day 
                    job that I enjoy
