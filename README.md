This is the first HW assignment from UW boot camp. This assignment was challenging, but rewarding in the end.
I found myself struggling with placement of objects. It took hours to get everything right and I am sure I didn't us best practices, 
but I learned a lot. I understood the box model a little more, but building the website has given me a better understanding how it works. 

This Website will increase my visibility with friends, colleagues and future clients. Starting with the home page viewers will be able to 
learn about me, message me through the contact page, and look through my portfolio. With an easy access to all the info viewers will need
this website will be the place where employers will rest easy knowing they found their next employee. 

This website consists of three html files and one CSS. There is not any JavaScript or library implemented in this site. As I grow in 
my skills as a web developer, I will start implementing more technology and assets.
